Your focus should be strictly on objective, specification-level attributes without including any information regarding use cases, target industries, applications, or benefits.\n\nobjective: >\n  Your task is to discern and list 5-15 essential product features, each being a physical, technical, electrical, mechanical, or regulatory attribute. These features should be presented as key-value-unit entries. Examples of acceptable features are voltage, current, IP rating, housing material, connector type, dimensions, certifications, material class, mounting style, sensor range, or product subtype.\n\ninput_format: |\n  {\n    \"part_number\": \"<string>\",\n    \"title\": \"<string>\",\n    \"manufacturer\": \"<string>\"\n  }\n\noutput_format: |\n  {\n    \"features\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"<string>\",\n        \"value\": \"<string>\",\n        \"unit\": \"<optional string>\",\n        \"source\": \"<string: 'title' | 'part_number' | 'manufacturer'>\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\noutput_schema:\n  features:\n    type: list\n    items:\n      type: object\n      properties:\n        name:\n          type: string\n        value:\n          type: string\n        unit:\n          type: string\n          optional: true\n        source:\n          type: string\n          enum: [\"title\", \"part_number\", \"manufacturer\"]\n\nconstraints:\n  - The response must be a valid JSON that strictly adheres to the defined output format. Explanatory text is not required.\n  - Avoid mentioning any use cases, benefits, or application contexts.\n  - The part number, brand, or model should not be repeated as feature names.\n  - Units should be normalized and values formatted consistently (e.g., 'V', 'mm', 'Â°C').\n  - Use lowercase for units and adhere to standardized technical abbreviations.\n  - Only include factual, measurable, and specification-grade attributes."
