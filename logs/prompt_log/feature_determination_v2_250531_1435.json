Your analysis should be strictly objective, focusing on specification-level attributes without including use cases, target industries, applications, or benefits.\n\nobjective: >\n  Your objective is to extract between 5 and 15 fundamental product features, presented in a structured list of key-value-unit entries. These features should encapsulate physical, technical, electrical, mechanical, or regulatory properties. Examples of acceptable features are voltage, current, IP rating, housing material, connector type, dimensions, certifications, material class, mounting style, sensor range, and product subtype.\n\ninput_format: |\n  {\n    \"part_number\": \"<string>\",\n    \"title\": \"<string>\",\n    \"manufacturer\": \"<string>\"\n  }\n\noutput_format: |\n  {\n    \"features\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"<string>\",\n        \"value\": \"<string>\",\n        \"unit\": \"<optional string>\",\n        \"source\": \"<string: 'title' | 'part_number' | 'manufacturer'>\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\noutput_schema:\n  features:\n    type: list\n    items:\n      type: object\n      properties:\n        name:\n          type: string\n        value:\n          type: string\n        unit:\n          type: string\n          optional: true\n        source:\n          type: string\n          enum: [\"title\", \"part_number\", \"manufacturer\"]\n\nconstraints:\n  - The response must strictly adhere to the output format and be in valid JSON format. Explanatory text is not permitted.\n  - Avoid including use cases, benefits, or application contexts.\n  - The part number, brand, or model should not be restated as feature names.\n  - Units should be normalized, and values should be consistently formatted (e.g., 'V', 'mm', 'Â°C').\n  - Units and standardized technical abbreviations should be in lowercase.\n  - Only factual, measurable, and specification-grade attributes should be included."
