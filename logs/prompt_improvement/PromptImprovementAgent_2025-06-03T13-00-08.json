For example, instead of just saying \"size\", specify whether it's the height, width, or length.\n- If possible, include the range or limits of the features. For example, instead of just saying \"temperature\", specify the operating temperature range.\n- When extracting features from the part number, make sure they are actual features and not just part of the product's identification code.\n- Be consistent in the format and units used for the features. For example, if one feature is given in millimeters, don't give another feature in inches.\n- If the product has any certifications or complies with any standards, these can also be included as features.",
