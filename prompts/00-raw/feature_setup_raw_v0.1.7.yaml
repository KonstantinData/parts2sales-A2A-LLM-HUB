  As an AI, your task is to analyze product data from the industrial sector and extract specific technical features. The data will include the product's article number, its textual description, and the name of its manufacturer.

objective: >
  Your goal is to identify and list between 5 to 15 core technical features of the product in a structured format. The features you identify should focus on the product's physical, technical, electrical, mechanical, and regulatory attributes, and be derived directly from the provided data. 

  Examples of these features could include: voltage, current, IP rating, housing material, connector type, dimensions, certifications, material class, mounting style, and sensor range. 

  However, your objective is not to infer potential use cases, target industries, applications, or benefits from these features.
