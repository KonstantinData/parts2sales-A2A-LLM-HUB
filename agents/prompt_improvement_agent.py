File: prompt_improvement_agent.py
Type: Python Module (Agent Class)

Purpose:
--------
This agent improves a YAML-based LLM prompt based on structured feedback received from the PromptQualityAgent.
It interprets the feedback (dimension-wise suggestions) and generates a refined prompt, while also explaining
the changes it applied.

Expected Input:
---------------
- original_prompt_text: str
- quality_feedback: dict (contains keys: score, score_components, suggestions, raw_review_log)

Output:
-------
- improved_prompt: str (revised YAML prompt)
- rationale: str (optional explanation why and what was changed)

Note:
-----
This version uses a placeholder logic. In production, this agent should use an LLM (e.g., GPT-4) or a
rule-based engine to map suggestions into concrete prompt improvements.
