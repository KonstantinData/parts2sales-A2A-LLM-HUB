# To-Do List for Agentic AI Development

## 1. Parallel Agent Execution

- [ ] **Goal:** Enable parallel execution of agents to increase efficiency.
  - [ ] Implement a queue or task management solution (e.g., Celery, asyncio) for parallel execution.
  - [ ] Define clear interfaces for agent communication and shared data pools.
  - [ ] Test concurrent processing of multiple prompts and optimize synchronization.

## 2. Cross-Agent Communication

- [ ] **Goal:** Allow agents to communicate directly and share information.
  - [ ] Develop a messaging system (e.g., Event-Bus or Pub/Sub) for agents.
  - [ ] Implement mechanisms to share relevant information and events between agents.
  - [ ] Add logging to trace information flow between agents.

## 3. Adaptive Learning and Feedback Loops

- [ ] **Goal:** Enable agents to learn from their results and feedback to improve future decisions.
  - [ ] Integrate feedback mechanisms to assess agent performance (e.g., via scoring metrics).
  - [ ] Develop a pipeline that learns from logs and dynamically adjusts agent rules.
  - [ ] Test and evaluate the effectiveness of adjustments through controlled experiments.

## 4. Targeted Code Changes

- [ ] **Goal:** Ensure code changes only affect the relevant, discussed areas.
  - [ ] Implement guidelines and reviews to ensure changes remain focused.
  - [ ] Use version control to clearly document changes and avoid unnecessary edits.
  - [ ] Conduct regular code reviews to verify adherence to guidelines.

## 5. Extension of AgentEvent Models

- [ ] **Goal:** Extend AgentEvent models for greater flexibility and traceability.
  - [ ] Add new fields or models useful for future requirements (e.g., more metadata).
  - [ ] Ensure all agents use and validate the updated models.
  - [ ] Test changes thoroughly and update documentation accordingly.
