# To-Do List for Agentic AI Development

## 1. Parallel Agent Execution

- [ ] **Goal:** Enable parallel execution of agents to increase efficiency.
  - [ ] Implement a queue or task management solution (e.g., Celery, asyncio) for parallel execution.
  - [ ] Define clear interfaces for agent communication and shared data pools.
  - [ ] Test concurrent processing of multiple prompts and optimize synchronization.

## 2. Cross-Agent Communication

- [ ] **Goal:** Allow agents to communicate directly and share information.
  - [ ] Develop a messaging system (e.g., Event-Bus or Pub/Sub) for agents.
  - [ ] Implement mechanisms to share relevant information and events between agents.
  - [ ] Add logging to trace information flow between agents.

## 3. Adaptive Learning and Feedback Loops

- [ ] **Goal:** Enable agents to learn from their results and feedback to improve future decisions.
  - [ ] Integrate feedback mechanisms to assess agent performance (e.g., via scoring metrics).
  - [ ] Develop a pipeline that learns from logs and dynamically adjusts agent rules.
  - [ ] Test and evaluate the effectiveness of adjustments through controlled experiments.

## 4. Targeted Code Changes

- [ ] **Goal:** Ensure code changes only affect the relevant, discussed areas.
  - [ ] Implement guidelines and reviews to ensure changes remain focused.
  - [ ] Use version control to clearly document changes and avoid unnecessary edits.
  - [ ] Conduct regular code reviews to verify adherence to guidelines.

## 5. Extension of AgentEvent Models

- [ ] **Goal:** Extend AgentEvent models for greater flexibility and traceability.
  - [ ] Add new fields or models useful for future requirements (e.g., more metadata).
  - [ ] Ensure all agents use and validate the updated models.
  - [ ] Test changes thoroughly and update documentation accordingly.

## Additional Task after Repository Analysis

* [ ] **Error Event Handling**
  * [ ] Review all agent classes for consistent error handling.
  * [ ] Ensure every agent emits an `AgentEvent` with `event_type="error"` and stack trace/context in payload on failure.
  * [ ] Add or update tests to check error event emission.
* [ ] **Payload Typing Consistency**
  * [ ] Refactor all agent event emissions to use strict Pydantic payload classes (e.g., `PromptQualityResult`) instead of generic dicts.
  * [ ] Update or add unit tests to validate event payloadsâ€™ structure and content.
  * [ ] Document the expected payload schema per event type.
* [ ] **Agent/Schema Synchronization**
  * [ ] Check all agent classes for fields in `AgentEvent` (e.g., `status`, `step_id`) and ensure they match the Pydantic schema.
  * [ ] If necessary, update `utils/schemas.py` for missing/extra fields or adjust agents to align with schema.
* [ ] **Documentation Improvements**
  * [ ] Extend the main README with a table mapping each agent to:
    * [ ] Event types it emits
    * [ ] Payload class used for each event
  * [ ] Add or update docstrings in each agent for clarity on event flow.
  * [ ] Add a visual diagram of the event-driven agent lifecycle (optional).
* [ ] **Pre-commit Hook for Data/Logs**
  * [ ] Add a pre-commit hook (e.g., via `pre-commit` framework) to block any commit that would add files under `data/` or `logs/` (except `.gitkeep`).
  * [ ] Document this hook in CONTRIBUTING or README.
* [ ] **Test Coverage & Integration**
  * [ ] Review and expand tests for event traceability across all agent flows (success and error).
  * [ ] Add integration tests to simulate full prompt lifecycle with event log verification.
* [ ] **General Code Hygiene**
  * [ ] Re-check for any legacy scripts or files (manual scan, e.g., in `scripts/`, `utils/`).
  * [ ] Verify `.gitignore` still matches privacy and workflow requirements after all changes.

---

* [ ] **Production-ready Public Access (Layer 03+)**
  * [ ] **API Layer**
    * [ ] Provide all agent functions as endpoints (e.g., with FastAPI, Flask, Django REST).
    * [ ] Expose endpoints for agent actions, event logs, and system health.
  * [ ] **Authentication & Authorization**
    * [ ] Integrate SSO or OAuth2 (e.g., Azure AD, Google Workspace) for employee login.
    * [ ] Set up JWT-based session handling and permission checks for each API route.
  * [ ] **Web & App Frontend**
    * [ ] Build a React (or similar) web interface for employees (core workflows: classification, feedback, reporting).
    * [ ] (Optional) Build a mobile app or PWA for on-the-go access.
  * [ ] **Deployment/Infrastructure**
    * [ ] Containerize backend and frontend (Docker).
    * [ ] Deploy on a secure cloud platform (Azure, AWS, GCP) with HTTPS.
    * [ ] Set up a reverse proxy (e.g., NGINX, Traefik) and internal subdomain.
    * [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline for build, test, deploy.
  * [ ] **Monitoring, Logging, Privacy**
    * [ ] Centralize logs and agent events (with privacy: anonymized where needed).
    * [ ] Add system monitoring and alerting (e.g., Prometheus, Sentry).
    * [ ] Review cloud/data settings for GDPR/company compliance.
  * [ ] **UX & Access Management**
    * [ ] Build clear cockpit/dashboard for users (status, logs, manual agent triggers).
    * [ ] Enforce role-based access control in both backend and frontend.
    * [ ] Document usage and provide help for employees.
  * [ ] **First Implementation Steps**
    * [ ] Set up a minimal API backend with authentication.
    * [ ] Create a simple web interface with login and at least one agent workflow.
    * [ ] Publish internally via subdomain and test with a pilot group.


This to-do list serves as a roadmap for the next steps in developing the agentic AI platform. Each task can be addressed collaboratively and incrementally to maximize the autonomy and efficiency of the agents.
